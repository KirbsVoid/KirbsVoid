- You can refer to me as you want! Kirbs is fine too, since that's my username (Yes, Kirbs because of Kirby, i love the Kirby videogame series)
- Any pronouns is fine, i'm nonbinary!
- Still quite new into coding and programming, i'm mostly focusing on videogame design and such
- My art skills are still quite unpolished, i'm quite decent at pixel art c:
- I'm Chilean, so my main language is Spanish! luckily i learned a lot of english, so i can understand and
write english fine enough (Although i suck at english pronuntiation)
- I forget about some stuff pretty easily, so sometimes i might have an issue to remember things i've recently
learned about, even if it's something of my interest, if i'm doing something related to another thing, i always
check up the other related things i've already done by myself just to make sure that the new thing i'm making
is being done correctly (Be it code, art, and such, also i said the word "thing" too many times, but you probably get what i'm talking about)
